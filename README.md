Ballot Bot is a community-driven, AI-enhanced voter education platform that prioritizes both truth and service in addressing the problem of misinformation and low voter turnout. 
Ballot Bot allows the user to create a login, and then input their zipcode and "issue" that they want to find more information about.
The Ballot Bot app outputs the national, state, and local candidates for the upcoming election and educates users on the stance of each candidate.
